Oasis infobyte python programming internship task files <br>
I have done 3 tasks during the internship namely : <br>
<b>Task2 - BMI calculator <br>
PROBLEM STATEMENT : <br>
Project Idea : BMI CALCULATOR <br>
Project Description: <br>
1. Develop a graphical BMI calculator with a user-friendly interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt. <br>
2. Prompts users for their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). Allows users to input weight and height. <br>
3. Calculates the BMI and classifies it into categories (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight) based on predefined ranges. <br>
4. Displays the BMI result and category to the user. <br>

Key Concepts and Challenges Satisfied: <br>
1. User Input Validation: Ensure valid user inputs within reasonable ranges and handle errors gracefully. <br>
2. BMI Calculation: Accurately implement the BMI formula. <br>
3. Categorization: Classify BMI values into health categories based on predefined ranges. <br>
4. GUI Design: Create an intuitive interface with labels, input fields, and result displays using Tkinter. <br>

<b>Task3 - random password generator <br>
PROBLEM STATEMENT : <br>
Project Idea : Random Password Generator <br>
Project Description : <br>
1. Creating a password generator in Python that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length and character types (letters, numbers, symbols). <br>
2. Allows users to specify password length and character set preferences. <br>
3. Develop an advanced password generator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt. <br>
4. Enhance it by including options for password complexity <br>

Key Concepts and Challenges Satisfied: <br>
1. Randomization: Learn how to generate random characters and strings. <br>
2. User Input Validation: Validate user input for password length and character types. <br>
3. Character Set Handling: Manage different character sets (letters, numbers, symbols). <br>
4. GUI Design: Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for password generation. <br>
5. Security Rules: Implement rules for generating strong, secure passwords. <br>
6. Customization: Enable users to customize password generation further, e.g., excluding specific characters <br>

<b>Task4 - Basic weather app <br>
PROBLEM STATEMENT : <br>
Project Idea : Basic Weather App
Project Description :
1. Creating a weather app in Python that fetches and displays current weather data for a user-specified location (e.g., city or ZIP code) using a weather API.
2.Shows basic information such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
3.Developing a graphical weather app with a user-friendly interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.

Key Concepts and Challenges Satisfied :
1.API Integration: Connect to a weather API and parse JSON data.
2.User Input Handling: Validate and process user input for location.
3.GUI Design: Create a user-friendly interface with input fields, weather data displays, and visual elements.
task 4 includes a config file to extract api key from the file
